# confronto-tra-parole
A program that repeatedly reads two words a and b from std input (max. 100 car. each) and prints a message on std output indicating whether the two words are the same
or which of the two words precedes the other (in the normal order lexicographical) and, in the latter case, even if one of the two words is a prefix or a suffix
of the other (in the event that the two words are neither suffix nor prefix of one on the other hand, the program does not print anything)
(for the notions of prefix and suffix see for example here: https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sottostringa). The program continues execution until the string "$$$" is entered.
A word is a string containing no spaces or newlines. Use only “type C” strings and the library functions for “type C” strings presented in class.
